Noterious 
=========

AngularJS note board built using Firebase.

Developing
----------
Install the dependencies with

`npm install`

Noterious is built with [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

Start a [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) workflow with

`gulp tdd`

If you prefer to use the local installation of gulp managed by npm, the TDD workflow may be started with

`node ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js tdd`

For continuous integration, tests may be executed by either of

`gulp test` or `npm test`
